## Introduction

ProgressCircle displays a circle that has a background color and is filled with another color. The fill level represents a progress between 0% and 100%. The circle has a hole in the middle (why didn't I call this progrject `sk-progress-doughnut`?) that can be used to display a short text (e.g. the current progress in percent).

The component is implemented as a Web Component using the awesome SkateJS project to normalize different browser behaviour and to include the polyfills required for some browsers.
